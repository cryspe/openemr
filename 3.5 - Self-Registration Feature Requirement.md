# 3.5.	Self-Registration Feature Requirement
The self-registration feature bypassed the controls locking the calls to the authorized PID in all the exploits above.  This feature is not enabled by default and the use cases are limited.  This limits the exposure of the exploits to a smaller group of practices that are implementing this feature.
As a final review, research was performed to identify a way to continue to exploit these same vulnerabilities if the self-registration function is turned off.
 
These exploits all make use of the session variable flag “register.”  A search through the code base for other areas that can set this flag resulted in an additional entry that sets this code when a password reset is requested from a patient within the patient portal.  This is achieved by calling “/portal/index.php?requestNew=true”, which activates the following segment of code:
```php
        /portal/index.php
        423: if (isset($_GET['requestNew'])) {
        424:    $_SESSION['register'] = true;
        425:    $_SESSION['authUser'] = 'portal-user';
        426:    $_SESSION['pid'] = true;
```
Once the session is initialized, the remaining code works the same.  Since the register flag is set, the “bootstrap_register” flag gets set, bypassing the “PID” checks, and since the API calls do not safeguard against use when the “bootstrap_register” flag is set, the exploits continue to function.  Setting the flag works even if the patient portal self-registration feature has never been enabled.  Turning the patient portal off completely does mitigate both session creation techniques.  However, due to the requirement of a patient portal in the HITECH Act and Meaningful Use Requirements, the adoption of a patient portal is near-ubiquitous (Heath, S., 2019)[^Heath].
