# 4.	Recommendations and Implications
Of the four vulnerabilities found in the review of the OpenEMR patient portal, the most problematic is the uncredentialed patient portal API access.  This vulnerability builds on the others to provide complete read/write access to the patient demographics.  The implication of such a breach can cause irreparable harm to the patients, and millions of dollars in legal fees, settlements, and fines from regulatory authorities.  In some cases, this may even be more than the practice can recover from, closing its doors and furthering the harm to patients by disrupting their care.

A prioritized approach to identifying and testing weaknesses in the application code provided immediate results by discovering and remediating four critical vulnerabilities that would put the patient information and the practice at risk. Using the prioritization outlined here, the 1.5 million lines of code in the application are reduced to just over 42 thousand.  This number is further reduced by reviewing the websiteâ€™s functionality and focusing on related code to less than 1,000 lines to find multiple high-priority defects in the application logic.

## 4.1.	Recommendations for the Developers
Open-source software provides a lower barrier of entry for attackers who can walk through the code, review comments, and test functionality on their servers.  This puts OpenEMR in a more vulnerable position than many closed-source competitors in the space.  In 2021 alone, twenty-six vulnerabilities of various severity were identified in the OpenEMR software (MITRE, 2022).  The rate of vulnerability identification and the severity of these vulnerabilities to practices that utilize the software requires a more thorough analysis of the codebase to identify and rectify vulnerabilities before attackers discover them with malicious intent.

Resources for such a task can be costly and beyond the current financial capabilities of an open-sourced project such as OpenEMR.  Prioritization efforts can remediate the high exposure areas of the application quickly and with minimal expertise.  By partnering with a university or certification authority such as The SANS Institute to use the OpenEMR codebase within the curriculum, vulnerabilities can be identified even faster, and students can achieve real-world experience.  This partnership would benefit the development team, students, practices, and patients that rely on the project.

## 4.2.	Recommendations for Future Research
This code review and dynamic analysis covered only a portion of the OpenEMR code base.  Many opportunities exist to further the research and find and patch additional vulnerabilities in this software.  The open-access, easy setup, low technical requirements, and responsive project owners make this a great application to learn enterprise application development and security testing.  Working with developers to put prioritization practices in place can allow multiple researchers to work on a project without significant overlap and provide a more thorough analysis within the limited scope.

While OpenEMR provides a complete codebase to assist in discovering vulnerabilities, many closed source EMRs were developed using similar techniques and created in an age where security was less at the forefront of the software development process.  Researchers wanting to advance their skills beyond applications with source code availability could find any number of desktop and web-based applications that secure the same sensitive information.  While Electronic Medical Record Systems have the highest exposure due to the necessity of patient interaction, the Practice Management Systems, Health Level 7 Information Exchanges, Radiology Information Systems, and the networks that protect these systems are in dire need of advancement in security.  Additional research into how vulnerable our healthcare systems are will improve our safety as patients and protect the healthcare providers we rely on from the burden of litigation.
