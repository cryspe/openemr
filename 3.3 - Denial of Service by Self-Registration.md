# 3.3.	Denial of Service through Patient Self-Registration
The self-registration process allows the creation of patient accounts directly into the practice medical record system.  When a patient completes the registration, the account is immediately available in the practice patient finder with no acceptance check or validation.  This led to the discovery of whether abuse of this system was possible.  A review of the process identified an API call responsible for the actual creation and population of the patient account.  This API call is accessed through “/portal/patient/api/patient” URL and takes a JSON encoded body element with all the patient registration details.

## 3.3.1.	Vulnerability Discovery
The patient creation API implements a check to ensure that there is no logged-in patient and that the register flag is set to true. As previously noted, a user obtains these conditions by starting the registration process.  The registration session is not destroyed, and the patient ID is not populated to the session during this call.  This leaves the patient creation call open to scripting abuse and the creation of an unlimited number of patients.

        /portal/patient/libs/Controller/PatientController.php
        203: if ($_SESSION['pid'] !== true && $_SESSION['register'] !== true) {
        204:   throw new Exception('Unauthorized');
        205: }

The “create” function also allows the patient to set a patient id in their request.  

        /portal/patient/libs/Controller/PatientController.php
        248: $patient->Pubpid = $this->SafeGetVal($json, 'pubpid', $patient->Pubpid);
        249: $patient->Pid = $this->SafeGetVal($json, 'pid', $patient->Pid);

This allows a malicious actor to abuse this field, setting it to a value where no more patient IDs are left to allocate.  When an employee tries to create a new patient account, a call to find the maximum value of a patient ID and add one to it is made to set the new account's patient ID. This causes an out-of-range exception.

        /interface/new/new_comprehensive_save.php
        43: $result = sqlQuery("SELECT MAX(pid)+1 AS pid FROM patient_data");

Similarly, suppose another patient tries to register on the patient portal. They are also denied since a similar function tries to look for the next available patient ID in the workflow.

        /portal/account/account.php
        127: $result = sqlQuery("select max(pid)+1 as pid from patient_data");

MITRE identifies not setting a proper limit to the number or frequency of an interaction with an actor as Improper Control of Interaction Frequency (CWE-799).  The ability to cause a denial-of-service condition by setting the PID value to the maximum allowable number is identified by MITRE as an Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770).

## 3.3.2.	Exploitation
Two scripts were created to exploit the mass-creation and denial-of-service vulnerabilities.  For the mass-creation exploit, a loop is used to generate a random patient and submit it to the application.  Since a single session is usable, each API call following the session creation inserts a new patient into the database, making it impossible to browse patient records due to the number of random patients.

Just as in the previous exploits, a creating a registration sessionis created first.  The next available patient ID is requested from “/portal/account/account.php?action=get_newpid” and used as an initial seed to begin the account creation loop.  A random first name, last name, email address, and date of birth are assigned to the new account and sent to the patient API in a JSON encoded body within the loop. Running the script for a few hours results in an unusable patient finder experience.

The full POC is provided in [Appendix C](https://github.com/crypse/openemr/Appendix%20C%20-%20DoS%20Patient%20Registration.ps1)
 
As discussed in Section 3.3.1, another use of this vulnerability allows the attacker to set the maximum value for the BIGINT type of 18446744073709551615 into the “PID” and “PubPID” fields. Once this value is accepted, any following requests to create a new patient will result in a datatype overflow and prevent the authorized user from creating the account.  This condition can be remedied by deleting the account but allows for re-exploitation.

The exploit code takes the same functionality to create the account as the other exploit in this section but hard codes the patient ID to 18446744073709551615.  No loops are necessary, and only a single API call is made.  

The complete POC code is provided in [Appendix D](https://github.com/cryspe/openemr/Appendix%20D%20-%20DoS%20Patient%20Registration%20BIGINT.ps1).

Following the exploit, the patient self-registration process fails with the error "BIGINT value is out of range in ``'max(`openemr`.`patient_data`.`pid`) + 1'"``
 
The patient registration for employees also fails with the error "BIGINT value is out of range in ``'max(`openemr`.`patient_data`.`pid`) + 1'"``
 
## 3.3.3.	Mitigation Advice
To mitigate the vulnerability, the ability to specify a patient ID should be removed from the system. If that functionality is needed, it should be moved to the administrative section as a separate call.  When a patient account is created, the “PID” should be set in the session, which would cause any subsequent attempts to fail.  This would need to be coupled with the previously mentioned captcha or similar guards against scripting use to limit the ability of an attacker to continue to make new sessions on the patient portal registration page.

## 3.3.4.	Scoring and Disclosure
This vulnerability is usable from the public internet and requires a low complexity of code to exploit. No privileges and no user interaction are required.  The inability to add a patient to the system would likely result in a loss of revenue for the practice; the continued new account creation would result in inefficiency for the practice and possibly result in denying the patient access to care while systems are taken offline to mitigate the vulnerability.  No data integrity or confidentiality is impacted; however, the availability of the patient registration feature is affected. These factors contribute to a base score of 5.3.  Since a reliable exploit exists and has been confirmed by the project owner, the temporal score is 5.2.  Finally, Environmental Score components follow the base score components and contribute to a score of 5.6. This calculates to a CVVS v3.1 score of 5.6.

The vulnerability, exploit, and CVVS calculations were provided to the project owners via secure email, who verified the receipt and began work on a patch to alleviate the issue.  Following the patch publication, the source code for the exploit was posted on GitHub, and a CVE was published to identify the vulnerability publicly and promote patching. The CVE ID issued for this vulnerability is CVE-2022-XXXXX.
