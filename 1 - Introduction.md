# 1.	Introduction
An Electronic Medical Record (EMR) can empower health care providers with efficiency, analytics, and portability.  Data previously stored in entire rooms of paper charts is suddenly available anywhere in the world and instantly retrievable.  The efficiencies gained in chart preparation and documentation lower the cost of healthcare. At the same time, the increased availability of analytics provides a method to continue research and correlation to combat new diseases and develop better and safer care plans.  Recognizing these advancements, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services began incentivizing the adoption of EMRs in 2011.  These incentives were followed by enforcement in 2015 when negative payment adjustments for non-adopters began. These benefits, combined with the threat of a lower payment, have resulted in a near-ubiquitous adoption of EMR in the healthcare industry (CMS, 2019).

Healthcare providers are required to retain these records for a minimum of six years in the United States, and many states require a minimum of ten years of retention (GWU, 2016). They have suddenly found themselves in the business of digital information security, far from their desired field of work.  The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) statistics show that healthcare providers are unprepared for this responsibility.  In 2021 alone, 430 healthcare providers reported a breach of 500 or more patient records. Six of these breaches involved more than one million patient records.  By the end of 2021, the exposure of more than 25 million patient records by hacking incidents was reported to the OCR, equating to a staggering 7.7% of the entire US population (OCR, 2021).

These breaches expose the patientsâ€™ sensitive information and impose a significant financial loss for the healthcare provider.  The average healthcare data breach costs $9.23 million (IBM Security, 2021).  The burden can easily be more than the insurance can cover between discovery and remediation costs, class action lawsuits, and regulatory penalties.  This can sometimes even result in business closure, as it did with Wood Ranch Medical and Brookside ENT and Hearing Center (Adler, S., 2019).  

Security researchers need to focus their time and effort on the areas of an application that are most likely to be exploited.  Then, as time and resources allow, they should dig deeper into the more protected components of the application.  This paper will examine an open-source, web-based EMR and associated patient portal for potential patient information alteration and disclosure vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities discovered will be used to provide a list of objectives for application developers and security researchers to prioritize their time and effort.
